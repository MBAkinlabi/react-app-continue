# 354. Required Testing Tools
- We need two tools to write great React test:
    1. Test runner - executes tests and provides validation library. --- Jest is a test runner and already installed with Create React App
    2. You need to emulate those components. Something like using a virtual DOM. 
    3. Testing utilities - it simulates everything - You could use `React Test Utils`, but you should use `Enzyme`. It's way more popular.
    - Keep these two tools in mind. They're the ones you need to learn to know everything testing in React.
