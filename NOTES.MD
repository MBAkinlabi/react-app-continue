# 431. Rules of Hooks
- You must only use Hooks in functional components or inside of other hooks. 
- You can't define `useState` or other hooks. Another way of saying initializing them in functions. It must be at the root of the functional component. It shouldn't be a function inside a functional component.
- You can only do that inside a hook and the functional component itself. 
- You can't do it in if statement too.
