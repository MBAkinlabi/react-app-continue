# 444. Using useReducer() for the Http State
- Using a `useReducer` is often cleaner than using a `useState()`
- The instructor clearly likes the idea of using the `useReducer()`
- Wow. using `useReducer` is so much easier if I can get my head around it.
- It's a great alternative to `useState()` if you have much lots of state.
- It's also the choice if multiple states work together. You can manage them in one place and update them correctly.
