- I forget to add `()` in front of `increment()` in the `Counter.js` file in the last lecture. 
- We've now completed setting up our action creators. And they look cool.
- Right now, only synchronous code run in them.
- But in the next lecture, we'll learn how to run asynchronous code in them.
- Wow, this looks super cool. 
- You should use action creators for both synchronous and asynchronous code. It's cool.
- You should use actionCreators. They're cool. They make your actions betters organized.
