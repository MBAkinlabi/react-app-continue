# 213. Handling Errors
- Handling errors using an higher order component. YOu learned about this earlierr and it's useful now.
- When there's an error, you display the error in the UI using this perfect method.
- And it's really cool to know this.
- What's being displayed changes to the error message on the screen. This is something you should keep in mind as you continue to learn.
- It's being emphasized to me myself that going back to these lectures is the only way to make them stick. I don't see how I can prevent being forgetful when I come across something this complex.
