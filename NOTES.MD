# 345. Using updateObject in the Entire App
- I corrected a mistake I made long time ago I believe. Instead of substracting from the total price, it was adding to it. Now that is corrected. I'm slowly becoming a real React developer. Wow. That's so nice.
- Now I can continue to my main work. 
- We used `updateObject` our utility function to reduce our code lines. It's so cool to know about DRY. And I can see that at work here.
