# 215. Removing Old Interceptors
- Wow. This phase took some time. Couldn't believe it. I could have easily solved it.
- I moved to `useEffect()` to see if I can solve the problem, but I couldn't. Now I know I need to learn alot about that function.
- Wow, I also realized that instead of using `componentWillMount` which has been deprecated, I can easily solve the problem by using the constructor.
- Still, a lot to learn on JavaScript.
- I'm slowly believing in myself and becoming that senior developer. This is getting interesting. Wow.
