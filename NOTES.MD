# 458. Converting the BurgerBuilder Container
- We converted the BurgerBuilder container too to use Hooks and it's cool.
- The instructor found a bug that I'd found and corrected myself a long time ago.
- The bug was when we click on "Less" to reduce the ingredients, it actually adds up. I found that small bug and corrected it. Hurray.
