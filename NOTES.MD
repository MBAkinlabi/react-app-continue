# 382. Production Workflow & Wrap Up
- To build for production, copy the `webpack.config.js` file and then rename it to `webpack.config.prod.js`
- Switch the `mode` from development to `production`
- Change `devtool` to `none`
- Add this to the scripts in `package.json` - `"build:prod": "webpack --config webpack.config.prod.js"`
- `npm run build:prod`
- Now the `dist` folder is available. 
- Now, that's what we can now deploy.
- We need to learn a lot about this app.
- The official documentation is where to get everything to learn webpack
- I strongly recommend `create-react-app` because it takes out all the time you have to spend configuring webpack.
