# 430. Multiple States
- In class-based components, states have to be an object and React merges it for you.
- In functional-based components that use `useState` states that don't have to be an object and React doesn't merge it for you.
- What, you can do is register multiple states with different `useState`
- You don't have to merge them again when you do it this way. 
- The instructor recommends this method. And it's so cool to me too.
