# 387. Setting Up a Project
- Followed the instructions here: https://nextjs.org/docs
- Run `npm init` and do what you have to do:
- `npm install --save next react react-dom`
- Again follow the instructions outlined in the Docs. The next step is to grab scripts and replace what you have on the site with the code. 
- It's all about following a certain files structure. It looks pretty simple and easy to me.
- Naming it `index.js` means it's available at that folder name.
- `npm run dev` to run it in development and see what's happening.
- Wow, this tool makes developing React apps so easy. OMG. It's working smoothly and fine.
- The components can be functional or class-based components. So easy. OMG.
