# 367. Example: Deploying on Firebase
- We're using Firebase Hosting
- `sudo npm install -g firebase-tools`
- `firebase login`
- `firebase init`
- Scroll to `Hosting` and press the `space` key to select it. 
- Enter `build` as the directory
- Yes to the single page question
- To the `File/build already exists. Overwrite?` The answer is no. 
- Now, you should see a new file which is the `firebaserc`
- It contains information about the project.
- Then go to `firebase.json` is where it does a lot of things like rewrite the URL. 
- `firebase deploy`
- And the URL of the Burger Builder is `https://react-my-burger-6c464.web.app`
- Wow.
- No matter the host you choose, the steps to deploying never changes. Deploying is the easiest thing. I've worked hard on this app. So deploying shouldn't be a problem at all.
