# 349. Adding Lazy Loading
- Here, I learned how lazy loading works.
- Although we've done lazy loading before in this course. It's just for the instructor to remind me again how it works.
- It's so powerful.
- Now we don't download a component unless we need it. This makes our app faster.
- If the app is small, you may not gain much from lazy loading.
- Still, to me, this is something I will do all the time to show my clients that I know how lazy loading works and why they need to hire me to build React apps for them.
