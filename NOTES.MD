# 356. Writing our First Test
- Back to the Burger Builder app.
- Quit the running app with `control + C`
- Jest is already installed if you're using `create-react-app` if not then you have to install it by yourself.
- Jest was already installed
- Go ahead and follow the instructor
- `npm install --save enzyme react-test-renderer enzyme-adapter-react-16`
- As you can see we just installed 3 packages there that are needed. 
- After setting up your unit test, you can go to the `package.json` file and scroll down to the `scripts`. There, you'll find the test scripts.
- `npm run test` or just `npm test`
- If you get a blocking error at this point, delete the `App.test.js` file and run it again.
- Wow, the test passed. It works. I should probably watch this video again and again to learn more about testing.
- However, I'm still going to learn about `Jest` and `Enzyme` separately on their docs as expected to really learn a lot about them.
