# 209. Creating the Firebase Project
- https://firebase.google.com/
- It's free for what we want to do. There're paid plans though. Paid plans remove some limits.
- `Go to Console` on the website. 
- `Create a project`
- Give your project a name and continue
- Click `Develop` => `Database`
- Make sure you choose `Realtime Database`
- The database `read` and `write` rules should both be set to `true`
- Copy the URL (or endpoint as the instructor calls it)
- You can start sending Http request to it.
- For me, it's https://react-my-burger-6c464.firebaseio.com/
