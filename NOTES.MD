# 378. Setting Up the Basic Webpack Config
- Inside the scripts in the `package.json` file, add this:
- `"start": "webpack-dev-server"`
- `npm install --save-dev webpack-cli`
- Create a webpack config file. `webpack.config.js` next to `package.json`
- You can learn all about Webpack on the documentation.
- If you want to become a Webpack master, you need to go there and really understand it. 
- You need to really learn webpack to configure it. The instructor took the time to explain some things here, but it's not all. A lot of things to learn to become a great webpack user.
- Not done. More to learn in the next lecture.
