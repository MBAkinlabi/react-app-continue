# 408. Alternative Animation Packages
- There're alternatives:
    1. React Motion - https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion
    2. React Move - https://github.com/react-tools/react-move
    3. React Router Transition - https://github.com/maisano/react-router-transition
    4. These animation libraries are really cool. They give me a lot of things. I'm really enjoying learning this React thing. It's so amazing with so many things to learn inside of it.
