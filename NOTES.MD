# 392. A Special Lifecycle Hook
- Instructor wants to show us a lifecycle hook that is available in both class-based and functional components. Next is really amazing.
- The lifecycle is `getInitialProps`
- It can be called without the component being instatiated yet and it's async which means it doesnt return immediately.
- You can use it to prepopulate your app with some props before it even loads. Wow. Really.
- You can initialize your props before the page is actually loaded. It seems good. Might use it as a replacement for state or redux. I think they were trying to take those two alternatives out by introducing their own.
- Seems like a good option to me.
