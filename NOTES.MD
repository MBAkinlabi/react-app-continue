# 425. What are "React Hooks"
- React Hooks allows us to work with functional components only.
- React Hooks can only be used in functional components or other hooks.
- They always start with `use` as in `useXYZ()`
- Hooks are highly re-usable.
- They have nothing to do with Lifecycle Methods ('Lifecyle Hooks')!
- Keep in mind that Lifecycle Hooks are only limited to class-based components.
- React Hooks was introduced in React 16.8
- You can use React Hooks for managing state, side effects (e.g. Http requests) and more.
