# 434. useEffect() & Loading Data
- useEffect() gets executed after every time the component re-render cycle.
- After the first render and every re-render.
- Be careful with infinite loop. Note that useEffect() get executed after every re-render, which means if you call a function that re-renders, `useEffect()` will continue to render. It won't stop.
- You can check the network tab and see if the network continue to reload or load new things. 
- **Keep this in mind as you use useEffect.**
- It doesn't matter if it's inside or outside the `useEffect()` loop. It'll continue to get executed after every re-render. 
- Used like this, `useEffect()` acts like `componentDidUpdate()` It runs the function after every component update (re-render).
- `useEffect()` takes a second argument. An array.
- The array contains the dependencies of the function. Only when the dependency change will the function re-run. This allows you to control how often the `useEffect()` function runs.
- In the array, you don't have to include the function that changes state like `setUserIngredients`. React knows that automatically. That's the only exception here. 
- If the `useEffect()` function has no dependecies internal the function or outside (in the component function), then you should add an empty array.
- Removing the array isn't an option. 
- When you use the empty `[]`, `useEffect()` acts like `componentDidMount`. It runs only once (after the first render. )
- Wow, `useEffect` is really  cool. I like it.
