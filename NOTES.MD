# 212. Displaying a Spinner while Sending a Request
- We want to create a spinner.
- We can find some nice spinners on the internet.
- Search Google for `css spinners`
- This site is nice: https://projects.lukehaas.me/css-loaders/
- We're picking one. 
- You can edit the background color and the other if you want.
- Select one and choose the CSS and HTML code and paste them in the appropriate places.
- It's a bit complex but easier to understand if we're tracking changes and organizing our thoughts.
- I learned about `nextProps.children` and `this.props.children`
