# 220. Setting Up the Router Package
- `npm install --save react-router react-router-dom`
- You need those two packages. 
- This package wasn't created by Facebook, but it's the defacto routing package for React.
- Note that you'll need to quit by pressing `control + C` before installing.
- And after installation, you'll need to run `npm + start`
- Now, you need to be able to read routes. You can do that inside `App.js` or `index.js` The author is using `App.js` and that may become what I use too. 
- We've wrapped it.
- Now we can even move `FullPost` and `NewPost` folders into the `Blog` folder which is a contanier.
- We ended this lecture without starting using routing.
- But we'll start doing that in the next lecture. The instructor is going to something nice. Let's look forward to it.
