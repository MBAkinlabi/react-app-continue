# 191. Understanding our Project and Introducing Axios
- Use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ as a fake online REST API for testing. 
- We'll use it to learn how to send HTTP requests.
- There are two ways to send HTTP requests
1. JavaScript has the XMLHttpRequest object. 
2. Axios (a third-party libray)
- Axios is recommended because it's easier and faster to use. 
- You can quickly learn about Axios on its GitHub page: https://github.com/axios/axios
- How to install Axios
- Quit the development server first.
- Run this:
```shell
npm install axios --save
```
- Then run `npm start`
