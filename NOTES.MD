# 279. Fixing a Bug
- The instructor noticed a bug in the `deliveryMethod` of the `ContactData.js`. If we don't switch, the `value` will always be an empty string.
- So the solution is to enter `Cheapest` or `Fastest` in the `value` that way it won't be an empty string. Wow, I'm getting better with this.
- The instructor would fix it later in the course.
