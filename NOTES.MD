# Planning an App in React - Core Steps
- This is the real 149 lecture.
- Plan the component tree or component structure first
- You need to plan the application state (data) next
- Then the next thing to plan is which component should be stateless (also called dumb), and which should be stateful
- It doesn't need to be perfect or complete. You just need something to start with and guide you through the whole process. That's why you need to do this.
- Having a plan is very important.
