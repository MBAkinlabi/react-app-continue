# 252. Setting Up Routing & Routes
- Installing React Router Dom for this Burger app
- `npm install --save react-router-dom react-router`
- You can also avoid us installing `react-router` because `react-router-dom` does wrap (or have it). But I'm including it so that you don't forget.
- So what I meant is that you can also do it like this:
- `npm install --save react-router-dom`
- After doing that, run `npm start` again to continue where you left.
- More information about `exact`
- Setting up the routes
- Using `Route` and `Switch`
- We'll continue in the next lecture
