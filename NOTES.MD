# 353. What is Testing?
- Testing doesn't mean we test our application manually. We should continue to do that though. We do that already and we should continue.
-  Testing means we write automated tests.
- Here are the steps:
    1. Build app
    2. Test manually in Browser
    3. Automatic tests
    4. Ship app to server
- When we later change anything in our code, we'll quickly find that through testing before we even check the browser. Something we break immediately. The testing tells us that.
- Don't add test later. Instead do TDD (test driven development)
- You write the test before you write any application code.
- We're not doing that now.
- We just want to do unit test and you can build on the knowledge yourself.
