# 218. Routing and SPAs
- We don't really have multiple pages. But we do have different Routs `/`, `/blog` and `/blog/post/1/` and so on to present different content to the user. We're simply re-rendering different content.
- We're using a Router package. 
- Parses URL / Path => Read Config => Render / Load appropriate JSX / Component.
