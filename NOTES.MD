# 326. Getting a Token from the Backend
- Firebase gives us authentication out of the box.
- This course isn't a full course on authentication. Just want to show you how it works in React.
- If you want to know how to build an API in your language of choice, you'll have to go and look for a course on that.
- We set up Firebase for Authentication. That was easy. You can find it right there in the dashboard or Project Overview as Firebase calls it.
- Search for `firebase rest auth` on Google.
- This URL: https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/auth
- There are different uses and cases. You should look at the right side of the screen on that page to see how things work. 
- Wow, this took a long time but I didn't give up. So nice that I didn't.
- I got it to work. I must have made a mistake with the URL or something. Or maybe I wasn't the following the instructor well enough.
- I should read more about Authentication and why they're needed more. 
- I'm adding that to my Evernote must do before I can call myself an experienced developer.
- I feel so happy right now.
