# 336. Persistent Auth State with localStorage
- How to use localStorage.
- Go to Chrome Browser Dev Tools and go to the `Application` from `>>`
- Right there, you'll find `Local Storage`
- Expand it and click on the domain (localhost in this case) and you'll see the localStorage data fields you set there. Key and values. 
- Wow, you got introduced to the Local Storage.
- Although, the app has an error someone in the `if and else` statement, you should understand what `Local Storage` does.
- It allows us to store some things in the browser so that we can get it immediately and use it.
- In this case, when we refresh the page, we're asked to sign in again which can be a pain in the ass.
- Instead we have a token that's saved somewhere and which expires at some time.
- If the token is expired, we're then asked to sign in again.
- So, this is what the token is all about. We can easily retrieve it from localStorage if we store it there.
- Now I understand how all these works.
- Wow, this is becoming clearer and clearer with each passing lecture.
