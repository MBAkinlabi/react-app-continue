# 264. Updating Arrays Immutably
- We were shown two ways to copy an array from the state object without touching it.
- The first way as shown in the comment is less popular but works.
- The second way is more common and works.
- The reason why we could use `filter()` is because `filter` returns a new array. Please keep this in mind.
- Filter returns elements in the array when it meets the condition.
- Wow. `Filter` is very interesting.
- Need to learn more about it.
