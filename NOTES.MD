# Author deleted some videos - New numbers ahead (but continue)
- I skipped some videos because they were legacy.
- I'll have to follow the structure instead of the numbers. But what can I do. I have to continue learning.
- The makers of these videos will continue to update them. I must continue to learn too.
- In the future, I'll have to create a solution for following these updates and ensure that I don't miss any thing the instructor uploads.
- Let's go.
