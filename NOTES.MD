# 295. An Alternative Folder Structure
- There several different folder structures
- You could create a store folder in every container. You could go that route too if you have a lot of containers.
- Each container folder has its store which has its actions and reducer folders too. You then combine everything together in your index.js file.
- You could also create a global store and has its own actions and reducer folders.
