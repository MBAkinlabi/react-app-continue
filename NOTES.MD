# 254. Navigating Back & To Next Page
- Learned about going back to the previous page.
- I also learned about replacing the URL. Well, we replaced the URL but the page itself didn't change. Maybe, we'll learned more about replace in the future lectures.
- But I do know push, which will take us to another page.
- This course is getting interesting with a lot of questions in my mind.
