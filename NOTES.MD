# 303. Executing Asynchronous Code
- Quit with `command + C`
- `npm install --save redux-thunk`
- `npm start`
- Remember we know need to use the Advanded store setup of the Redux Devtools, which is found on the github page.
- Just follow the instructor.
- Never forget this setup. This is the advanced setup of course. Remember we're executing asynchronous code here and this is needed if we must run it.
