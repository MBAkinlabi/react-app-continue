# 453. Routing with React.lazy()
- All those redux stuff can stay as they are because they are not components.
- We deleted the whole `asyncComponent` folder. Instructor said it's not worth converting it. It returns a class-based component.
- Instead, we're use React.lazy(). It does everything we have to do manually with `asyncComponent`
- React.lazy looks cool.
