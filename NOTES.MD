# 359. Testing Components Correctly
- Writing good test is complicated. It's easy to write 100 tests for a given components.
- On the other hand, you may need only one test to see that a component is working correctly.
- Write a lot of tests to learn. Write a lot of tests for different components.
- Test for different things
- Learn how to use different functions from Jest and Enzyme
- Look at the crucial things and test them.
- For work, test the key things. 
- Your test code also changes when you touch your main file (the component file). Your tests could fail and you see what's happening.
- Think about what could easily break in your component and app and write a test code for exactly that.
