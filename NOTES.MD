# 168. Showing & Hiding the Modal with Animation!
- The author had a problem during this lecture which I should remember very clearly the next time I'm checking this.
- He mistakenly used `functionName() {}` that kind of function and the `this` keyword problems was global. 
- He had to change it back to the normal arrow function way, which is `functionName = () => this.setState()` before it works.
- So, this is something to keep in mind though the error has been corrected, you may remember it when you get here.
- Remember that when also learn about using `true` or `false` statements to change the value of a property in the CSS stylesheet. I'm talking about the ternary operator here.
