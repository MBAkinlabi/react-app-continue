# 348. Removing console.log()s
- Well, the instructor checked the console.log and there was an error that's been showing since during the lectures.
- The instructor removed an unused var that was declared and not used.
- I'd removed mine since and the instructor is just doing the same thing here.
- It's a good idea to remove everything in the console.log
- We use this to build our app and monitor things where they might be a mistake. 
- But once we're done, it's a good idea to remove all of them.
- I guess so that people won't see it.
- Wow, we removed all the `console.log`s that we have in the app. That's cool. It's looking better. Make sure that you don't leave them.
- Removing them is easy. Just type `console` into the file after you want to remove it.
- You can find the console.log from using the app and you'll be seeing it all over the place.
