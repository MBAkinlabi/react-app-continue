# 186. Changing the Folder Structure
- We move the `Layout` folder which contains a class-based component to the container folder. 
- You could also move the `Layout` folder which contains the class-based component into the Higher order component folder (hoc) because it's also a high order component itself. The HOC way is the instructor's favorite. Both are cool though. 
- We didn't do much in this lecture. Just changing a bunch of folders.
