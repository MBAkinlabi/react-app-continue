# 153. Setting up the Project
- The new app was downloaded. Added. That's the my-app folder.
- Because I'm using `create-react-app` I need to run `npm run eject`.
- Remember the reason why I'm doing this is to use CSS Modules.
- If I'd been using version 2, it would have been easier by using the `name.module.css` type and make it easy according to what I learned earlier.
- Before `npm run eject` can run, I save uncommited changes by running `git commit -m "Commit message"` of course.
