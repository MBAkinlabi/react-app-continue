# 484. Static React Apps with Gatsby.js
- GatsbyJS is actually a library built up on React. It's so cool.
- It's just like Next.JS did.
- Although, Gatsby serves a different purpose. 
- It allows you to build static website (a site that uses just HTML and CSS).
- No React Router or things like that. Instead you have a folder structure. 
- You use it to build websites like in the 90's but in this case, you're using React. 
- The library does most of the work for you.
- You can learn more about it on https://www.gatsbyjs.org/
- Start with the docs to learn how to use it.
