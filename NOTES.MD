# 159. Outputting Burger Ingredients Dynamically
- A very complex way (to me) to turn an object into array and do more. Wow. This is interesting.
- Note that `props.ingredients[igKey]` can also be written as `props.ingredients.igKey`
- It's just a way of accessing the object.
- Read more about `Array()` though as the number in it like `Array(4)` means the array length is 4.
- Looks very complex but easy when I can get my wrap my head around it.
- Great lecture. May come back to it more in the future to learn more.
- Note that the `bacon: 1` change was `2` before I realized my mistake and corrected it. I should prevent stupid mistakes like this from occuring in the future.
