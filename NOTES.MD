# 261. Passing and Retrieving Data with Action
- The instructor had an assignment where he added for the Decrement, Add, and Subtract.
- Now, I have to look at the screen and write it. 
- Note that in the `dispatch` on Counter.js, we can also add an object where we have val. You can have an object like `payload: {}` something like that there.
