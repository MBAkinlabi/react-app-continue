# 386. Understanding Server Side Rendering
- NextJS GitHub: https://github.com/zeit/next.js/
- NextJS site: https://nextjs.org/
- How server side rendering works
- NextJS helps with SSR
- I should be able to do server side rendering without using NextJS
- I need to figure that out myself.
- NextJS helps return everything and make sure that they're prerendered to the client (browser).
- While NextJS helps take care of that, it's something worth looking at for me.
