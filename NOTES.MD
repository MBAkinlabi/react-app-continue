# 284. Understanding the Redux Flow
- The component doesn't manipulate the app state directly when using Redux. It doesn't manipulate the central store (Redux)
- The component dispatches Actions (what to do maybe like reduce ingredients or something of that sort).
- The Actions reaches Reducers.
- In the end, you'll have one Reducer, which directly connects to the store.
- The Reducer can check the type of the Action, then we'll define the code for that type of action in the Reducer.
- Well, the reducer is pure function which receives the action and the old state. 
- The reducer has to execute synchronous code only. No asynchronous code. No side effects. No Http requests. 
- How do we get the updated state into our components then?
- For that, we use Subscription model.
- The store triggers all Subscriptions whenever the state changes. Whenever the state is updated in the store. 
- Of course, our component can subscribe to store (state) updates. They receive it automatically.
