# 446. Performance Optimizations with useMemo()
- Let's see how we can optimize our project. How we can avoid unnecessary re-render cycles.
- If a component depends on a component that re-renders when something happens, it'll re-render too even if it uses `React.memo`
- You can always include a `console.log` to confirm if a component is rendering. There, you'll see if it's re-rendering when it shouldn't.
- What you do is simple, simply wrap the function that is causing the re-rendering with `useCallback` That means
- Note that we have to specify its dependencies in the array.
- In this case, the `dispatchHttp` is from `useReducer` which like `useState`, React will take care of it for us. We don't need to specify.
- The `loading` is always touched so it causes the `ingredientForm.js` to re-render because it uses `loading`
- The alternative of `React.memo` is `useMemo`
- `useMemo` ensures no value is recreated
- If we're talking about storing React components, you maybe want to use React.Memo instead of `useMemo`
- But with `useMemo` you want to store any data you don't want to recreate when it re-renders.
- It's not the end of the world if you don't use it. But it's important you to improve performance.
